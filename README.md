# React Weather Application
This is a React application that accepts a user input city and returns the
current temperature. The application requires an API key from
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

To run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/herman-ho/react-weather.git
cd react-weather
# place OpenWeatherMap API key in:
# app/api/openWeatherMap.jsx
npm install
webpack
node server.js
```
